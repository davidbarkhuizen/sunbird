This project draws heavily on work done by [Kerry D Wong](http://www.kerrywong.com/about/) - who reverse engineered the IR communications protocol used by the Syma S107G, built a reference control circuit that implements that protocol, and then [made her research publicly available](http://www.kerrywong.com/2012/08/27/reverse-engineering-the-syma-s107g-ir-protocol/).
